# Baking Bread - An idiot's guide

## Ingredients and Equipment
1. Bread flour

    If you use all purpose flour, it still works but it'll be less bread-y than bread flour. I use King Arthur's bread flour.
    
2. Yeast
   
   You can buy a small packets of yeast (a few Tbsp), but if you want to make a habit of breadmaking, it's better to buy in bulk.
   Look for SAF Instant Yeast in a red package. They sell a 1lb brick of it for about $10.
   I usually keep the whole thing in the freezer and it'll last at least a few years. 
   You'll probably never use up the full pound of it, so give some to your friends!
   You do NOT need to add water or defrost it. When you use it, just take it straight out of the freezer, measure it, and add it to the recipe.
   
3. A baking sheet

   A baking sheet is pretty much the only baking equipment I have. Some recipes call for a dutch oven (basically a big pot), but they tend to be expensive.
   Do NOT use a regular pot with rubber handles that will melt.
   Cheap nonstick baking sheets tend to not handle high temperatures well. They warp and have their nonstick coatings ruined very quickly at high temperatures.
It was okay the first ~5 times but after that, my bread got stuck to the pan and I didn't want to have a ton of flour on the bottom so I decided to buy a new baking sheet.
   I now use a Caraway ceramic baking sheet that claims to be oven safe to temperatures above 500F. It doesn't warp much and stays nonstick. 
   Compared to most cheap baking sheets at $20 or under, I got my ceramic one for about $50, but IMO it's the best bang for the buck compared to a dutch oven which will be $100-$400.
 

4. A big mixing bowl

   I use an OXO brand 5 quart mixing bowl. It's nice because the bread doesn't really stick to the sides of this bowl.
   
 ## Recipe
 The original recipe is from https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread.
 
 1. Add the following to a mixing bowl and mix them well with a whisk.
  * 3 1/3 cup of flour
  * 2 tsp of salt
  * 1/4 tsp of instant yeast (see notes above on yeast)
2. Measure 1 1/2 cup of water. It can just be room temperature tap water. Drizzle it in the mixing bowl. 
3. Use your CLEAN hands to mix the dry ingredients with the water.
It'll be shaggy and sticky. If you measured correctly (by leveling the measuring cups for the flour and using a LIQUID measuring cup for water) the ratios should be ok.
Also make sure there's no dry bits of flour on the bottom, etc.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. I actually use a plastic bag and cover up the mixing bowl since I don't have a single use plastic wrap at home. 
The important thing is that it should be fairly air tight.
4. For the most important step: Neglect. Leave it at room temperature for 12-18 hours. Don't leave it in a place that's too hot (in the sun) or too cold.
I usually do this step at 6pm so I can bake it at noon.
5. The next step according to the recipe is to flour a work surface and fold it. 

   DO NOT skip this step. I made this mistake and jumped directly to shaping the bread and then popping it in the oven and it came out very dense. It's actually really important to fold as well as wait.
  
   Instead of folding on a floured work surface, I prefer to use use my hands without any additional flour to fold the bread onto itself in the air. I basically stretch it out one way and then fold and stretch out the other way and fold it again, and then shape into a ball. 
   Then I plop the ball onto a floured baking sheet. When I folded it while it was on the floured baking sheet, I incorporated too much flour in one area which you could tell when it was fully baked.
   The bread is not that sticky, so you don't need flour on your hands. Since I have a pretty good baking sheet, you also don't need that much flour on that either. 
   I've heard that you can use parchment paper to line the baking sheet instead, but I've never actually tried this myself. Be careful though! Wax paper is NOT the same as parchment paper and will burn.

6. The recipe says to cover with plastic wrap, but I prefer to just invert my mixing bowl upside down to cover the bread, being careful not to touch the sides of the bread.

7. Let the bread rest on the counter for 2 hours. I usually set a timer at 1.5 hours and then preheat the oven to 450F so that the oven is preheated at the 2 hour mark. 

   The original recipe says 2-3 hours, so I experimented with 2, 2.5, and 3 hours and I find that 2 hours seems to work the best. The full 3 hours tends to lead to flatter loaves.
 
   One time I totally forgot about the bread and waited more than 3 hours. The bread come out way too thin and flat since I didn't reshape it.

8. Once the oven is at 450F, bake for 40 minutes. Follow the instructions in the original recipe if you are using a dutch oven instead. Do not open the oven to look at the bread (this lowers the temperature).

9. When the bread is ready, move it to a cooling rack if you have one. If you don't have one, just angle the bread on the edge of the pan so there's a gap between the bread and the pan to prevent it from steaming and getting soft on the bottom.
   Wait for the bread to cool before cutting it.
   
10. Enjoy!
